# Multi-Input Tools

This notebook shows how to use a tool that requires multiple inputs with an agent. The recommended way to do so is with the `StructuredTool` class.

```python
import os  
  
os.environ["LANGCHAIN\_TRACING"] = "true"  

```

```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI  
from langchain.agents import initialize\_agent, AgentType  
  
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)  

```

```python
from langchain.tools import StructuredTool  
  
  
def multiplier(a: float, b: float) -> float:  
 """Multiply the provided floats."""  
 return a \* b  
  
  
tool = StructuredTool.from\_function(multiplier)  

```

```python
# Structured tools are compatible with the STRUCTURED\_CHAT\_ZERO\_SHOT\_REACT\_DESCRIPTION agent type.  
agent\_executor = initialize\_agent(  
 [tool],  
 llm,  
 agent=AgentType.STRUCTURED\_CHAT\_ZERO\_SHOT\_REACT\_DESCRIPTION,  
 verbose=True,  
)  

```

```python
agent\_executor.run("What is 3 times 4")  

```

```text
   
   
 > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...  
   
 Thought: I need to multiply 3 and 4  
 Action:  
```

{\
"action": "multiplier",\
"action_input": {"a": 3, "b": 4}\
}

```
  
Observation: 12  
Thought: I know what to respond  
Action:  
```

{\
"action": "Final Answer",\
"action_input": "3 times 4 is 12"\
}

```
  
> Finished chain.  
 
 
 
 
 
'3 times 4 is 12'  

```

## Multi-Input Tools with a string format[â€‹](#multi-input-tools-with-a-string-format "Direct link to Multi-Input Tools with a string format")

An alternative to the structured tool would be to use the regular `Tool` class and accept a single string. The tool would then have to handle the parsing logic to extract the relevant values from the text, which tightly couples the tool representation to the agent prompt. This is still useful if the underlying language model can't reliably generate structured schema.

Let's take the multiplication function as an example. In order to use this, we will tell the agent to generate the "Action Input" as a comma-separated list of length two. We will then write a thin wrapper that takes a string, splits it into two around a comma, and passes both parsed sides as integers to the multiplication function.

```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI  
from langchain.agents import initialize\_agent, Tool  
from langchain.agents import AgentType  

```

Here is the multiplication function, as well as a wrapper to parse a string as input.

```python
def multiplier(a, b):  
 return a \* b  
  
  
def parsing\_multiplier(string):  
 a, b = string.split(",")  
 return multiplier(int(a), int(b))  

```

```python
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)  
tools = [  
 Tool(  
 name="Multiplier",  
 func=parsing\_multiplier,  
 description="useful for when you need to multiply two numbers together. The input to this tool should be a comma separated list of numbers of length two, representing the two numbers you want to multiply together. For example, `1,2` would be the input if you wanted to multiply 1 by 2.",  
 )  
]  
mrkl = initialize\_agent(  
 tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO\_SHOT\_REACT\_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True  
)  

```

```python
mrkl.run("What is 3 times 4")  

```

```text
   
   
 > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...  
 I need to multiply two numbers  
 Action: Multiplier  
 Action Input: 3,4  
 Observation: 12  
 Thought: I now know the final answer  
 Final Answer: 3 times 4 is 12  
   
 > Finished chain.  
  
  
  
  
  
 '3 times 4 is 12'  

```
