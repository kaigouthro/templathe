# Multiple Memory classes

We can use multiple memory classes in the same chain. To combine multiple memory classes, we initialize and use the `CombinedMemory` class.

```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI  
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate  
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain  
from langchain.memory import (  
 ConversationBufferMemory,  
 CombinedMemory,  
 ConversationSummaryMemory,  
)  
  
  
conv\_memory = ConversationBufferMemory(  
 memory\_key="chat\_history\_lines", input\_key="input"  
)  
  
summary\_memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=OpenAI(), input\_key="input")  
# Combined  
memory = CombinedMemory(memories=[conv\_memory, summary\_memory])  
\_DEFAULT\_TEMPLATE = """The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.
