# SpaCy

[spaCy](https://spacy.io/) is an open-source software library for advanced natural language processing, written in the programming languages Python and Cython.

## Installation and Setup[​](#installation-and-setup "Direct link to Installation and Setup")

```python
#!pip install spacy  

```

Import the necessary classes

```python
from langchain.embeddings.spacy\_embeddings import SpacyEmbeddings  

```

## Example[​](#example "Direct link to Example")

Initialize SpacyEmbeddings.This will load the Spacy model into memory.

```python
embedder = SpacyEmbeddings()  

```

Define some example texts . These could be any documents that you want to analyze - for example, news articles, social media posts, or product reviews.

```python
texts = [  
 "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.",  
 "Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs.",  
 "How vexingly quick daft zebras jump!",  
 "Bright vixens jump; dozy fowl quack.",  
]  

```

Generate and print embeddings for the texts . The SpacyEmbeddings class generates an embedding for each document, which is a numerical representation of the document's content. These embeddings can be used for various natural language processing tasks, such as document similarity comparison or text classification.

```python
embeddings = embedder.embed\_documents(texts)  
for i, embedding in enumerate(embeddings):  
 print(f"Embedding for document {i+1}: {embedding}")  

```

Generate and print an embedding for a single piece of text. You can also generate an embedding for a single piece of text, such as a search query. This can be useful for tasks like information retrieval, where you want to find documents that are similar to a given query.

```python
query = "Quick foxes and lazy dogs."  
query\_embedding = embedder.embed\_query(query)  
print(f"Embedding for query: {query\_embedding}")  

```
