# Together AI

The Together API makes it easy to fine-tune or run leading open-source models with a couple lines of code. We have integrated the worldâ€™s leading open-source models, including Llama-2, RedPajama, Falcon, Alpaca, Stable Diffusion XL, and more. Read more: <https://together.ai>

To use, you'll need an API key which you can find here:
<https://api.together.xyz/settings/api-keys>. This can be passed in as init param
`together_api_key` or set as environment variable `TOGETHER_API_KEY`.

from langchain.llms import Together

input\_ = """You are a teacher with a deep knowledge of machine learning and AI. \  
You provide succinct and accurate answers. Answer the following question:   
  
What is a large language model?"""  
print(llm(input\_))
