# Github

The `Github` toolkit contains tools that enable an LLM agent to interact with a github repository.
The tool is a wrapper for the [PyGitHub](https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub) library.

## Quickstart[​](#quickstart "Direct link to Quickstart")

1. Install the pygithub library
1. Create a Github app
1. Set your environmental variables
1. Pass the tools to your agent with `toolkit.get_tools()`

Each of these steps will be explained in great detail below.

1. **Get Issues**- fetches issues from the repository.
1. **Get Issue**- fetches details about a specific issue.
1. **Comment on Issue**- posts a comment on a specific issue.
1. **Create Pull Request**- creates a pull request from the bot's working branch to the base branch.
1. **Create File**- creates a new file in the repository.
1. **Read File**- reads a file from the repository.
1. **Update File**- updates a file in the repository.
1. **Delete File**- deletes a file from the repository.

**Get Issues**- fetches issues from the repository.

**Get Issue**- fetches details about a specific issue.

**Comment on Issue**- posts a comment on a specific issue.

**Create Pull Request**- creates a pull request from the bot's working branch to the base branch.

**Create File**- creates a new file in the repository.

**Read File**- reads a file from the repository.

**Update File**- updates a file in the repository.

**Delete File**- deletes a file from the repository.

## Setup[​](#setup "Direct link to Setup")

### 1. Install the `pygithub` library[​](#1-install-the-pygithub-library "Direct link to 1-install-the-pygithub-library")

```python
%pip install pygithub  

```

### 2. Create a Github App[​](#2-create-a-github-app "Direct link to 2. Create a Github App")

[Follow the instructions here](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/registering-a-github-app/registering-a-github-app) to create and register a Github app. Make sure your app has the following [repository permissions:](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/permissions-required-for-github-apps?apiVersion=2022-11-28)

- Commit statuses (read only)
- Contents (read and write)
- Issues (read and write)
- Metadata (read only)
- Pull requests (read and write)

Once the app has been registered, add it to the repository you wish the bot to act upon.

### 3. Set Environmental Variables[​](#3-set-environmental-variables "Direct link to 3. Set Environmental Variables")

Before initializing your agent, the following environmental variables need to be set:

- **GITHUB_APP_ID**- A six digit number found in your app's general settings
- **GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY**- The location of your app's private key .pem file
- **GITHUB_REPOSITORY**- The name of the Github repository you want your bot to act upon. Must follow the format {username}/{repo-name}. Make sure the app has been added to this repository first!
- **GITHUB_BRANCH**- The branch where the bot will make its commits. Defaults to 'master.'
- **GITHUB_BASE_BRANCH**- The base branch of your repo, usually either 'main' or 'master.' This is where pull requests will base from. Defaults to 'master.'

## Example: Simple Agent[​](#example-simple-agent "Direct link to Example: Simple Agent")

```python
import os  
from langchain.agents import AgentType  
from langchain.agents import initialize\_agent  
from langchain.agents.agent\_toolkits.github.toolkit import GitHubToolkit  
from langchain.llms import OpenAI  
from langchain.utilities.github import GitHubAPIWrapper  

```

```python
# Set your environment variables using os.environ  
os.environ["GITHUB\_APP\_ID"] = "123456"  
os.environ["GITHUB\_APP\_PRIVATE\_KEY"] = "path/to/your/private-key.pem"  
os.environ["GITHUB\_REPOSITORY"] = "username/repo-name"  
os.environ["GITHUB\_BRANCH"] = "bot-branch-name"  
os.environ["GITHUB\_BASE\_BRANCH"] = "main"  
  
# This example also requires an OpenAI API key  
os.environ["OPENAI\_API\_KEY"] = ""  

```

```python
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)  
github = GitHubAPIWrapper()  
toolkit = GitHubToolkit.from\_github\_api\_wrapper(github)  
agent = initialize\_agent(  
 toolkit.get\_tools(), llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO\_SHOT\_REACT\_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True  
)  

```

```python
agent.run(  
 "You have the software engineering capabilities of a Google Principle engineer. You are tasked with completing issues on a github repository. Please look at the existing issues and complete them."  
)  

```

```text

 Final Answer: The README.md file has been updated with the new content.  
   
 > Finished chain.  
  
  
  
  
  
 'The README.md file has been updated with the new content.'  

```

## Example: Advanced Agent[​](#example-advanced-agent "Direct link to Example: Advanced Agent")

If your agent does not need to use all 8 tools, you can build tools individually to use. For this example, we'll make an agent that does not use the create_file, delete_file or create_pull_request tools, but can also use duckduckgo-search.

```python
%pip install duckduckgo-search  

```

```python
from langchain.tools.github.tool import GitHubAction  
from langchain.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchRun  
from langchain.agents import Tool  
from langchain.chat\_models import ChatOpenAI  
  
tools = []  
unwanted\_tools = ['Get Issue','Delete File', 'Create File', 'Create Pull Request']  
  
for tool in toolkit.get\_tools():  
 if tool.name not in unwanted\_tools:  
 tools.append(tool)  
tools+= [  
 Tool(  
 name = "Search",  
 func = DuckDuckGoSearchRun().run,  
 description = "useful for when you need to search the web"  
 )]  
   
agent = initialize\_agent(  
 tools = tools,  
 llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.1),  
 agent = AgentType.ZERO\_SHOT\_REACT\_DESCRIPTION,  
 verbose = True  
)  

```

Finally let's build a prompt and test it out!

```python
# The GitHubAPIWrapper can be used outside of an agent, too  
# This gets the info about issue number 9, since we want to  
# force the agent to address this specific issue.  
  
issue = github.get\_issue(9)  
  
prompt = f"""

Then execute the plan and use tools appropriately.  
Finally, make a pull request to merge your changes.

agent.run(prompt)  

```

```text

 To complete this issue, I need to find the most popular frontend framework and add a blurb about how this website will utilize it to the readme.md file. I should start by researching the most popular frontend frameworks and then update the readme file accordingly. I will use the "Search" tool to research the most popular frontend framework.
