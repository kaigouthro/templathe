# Gitlab

The `Gitlab` toolkit contains tools that enable an LLM agent to interact with a gitlab repository.
The tool is a wrapper for the [python-gitlab](https://github.com/python-gitlab/python-gitlab) library.

## Quickstart[​](#quickstart "Direct link to Quickstart")

1. Install the python-gitlab library
1. Create a Gitlab personal access token
1. Set your environmental variables
1. Pass the tools to your agent with `toolkit.get_tools()`

Each of these steps will be explained in great detail below.

1. **Get Issues**- fetches issues from the repository.
1. **Get Issue**- fetches details about a specific issue.
1. **Comment on Issue**- posts a comment on a specific issue.
1. **Create Pull Request**- creates a pull request from the bot's working branch to the base branch.
1. **Create File**- creates a new file in the repository.
1. **Read File**- reads a file from the repository.
1. **Update File**- updates a file in the repository.
1. **Delete File**- deletes a file from the repository.

## Setup[​](#setup "Direct link to Setup")

### 1. Install the `python-gitlab` library[​](#1-install-the-python-gitlab-library "Direct link to 1-install-the-python-gitlab-library")

```python
%pip install python-gitlab  

```

### 2. Create a Gitlab personal access token[​](#2-create-a-gitlab-personal-access-token "Direct link to 2. Create a Gitlab personal access token")

[Follow the instructions here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html) to create a Gitlab personal access token. Make sure your app has the following repository permissions:

- read_api
- read_repository
- write_repository

### 3. Set Environmental Variables[​](#3-set-environmental-variables "Direct link to 3. Set Environmental Variables")

Before initializing your agent, the following environmental variables need to be set:

- **GITLAB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN**- The personal access token you created in the last step
- **GITLAB_REPOSITORY**- The name of the Gitlab repository you want your bot to act upon. Must follow the format {username}/{repo-name}.
- **GITLAB_BRANCH**- The branch where the bot will make its commits. Defaults to 'main.'
- **GITLAB_BASE_BRANCH**- The base branch of your repo, usually either 'main' or 'master.' This is where pull requests will base from. Defaults to 'main.'

## Example: Simple Agent[​](#example-simple-agent "Direct link to Example: Simple Agent")

```python
import os  
from langchain.agents import AgentType  
from langchain.agents import initialize\_agent  
from langchain.agents.agent\_toolkits.gitlab.toolkit import GitLabToolkit  
from langchain.llms import OpenAI  
from langchain.utilities.gitlab import GitLabAPIWrapper  

```

```python
# Set your environment variables using os.environ  
os.environ["GITLAB\_PERSONAL\_ACCESS\_TOKEN"] = ""  
os.environ["GITLAB\_REPOSITORY"] = "username/repo-name"  
os.environ["GITLAB\_BRANCH"] = "bot-branch-name"  
os.environ["GITLAB\_BASE\_BRANCH"] = "main"  
  
# This example also requires an OpenAI API key  
os.environ["OPENAI\_API\_KEY"] = ""  

```

```python
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)  
gitlab = GitLabAPIWrapper()  
toolkit = GitLabToolkit.from\_gitlab\_api\_wrapper(gitlab)  
agent = initialize\_agent(  
 toolkit.get\_tools(), llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO\_SHOT\_REACT\_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True  
)  

```

```python
agent.run(  
 "You have the software engineering capabilities of a Google Principle engineer. You are tasked with completing issues on a gitlab repository. Please look at the open issues and complete them by creating pull requests that solve the issues."  
)  

```
