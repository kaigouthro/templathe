# EPub

[EPUB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB) is an e-book file format that uses the ".epub" file extension. The term is short for electronic publication and is sometimes styled ePub. `EPUB` is supported by many e-readers, and compatible software is available for most smartphones, tablets, and computers.

This covers how to load `.epub` documents into the Document format that we can use downstream. You'll need to install the [`pandoc`](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) package for this loader to work.

```python
#!pip install pandoc  

```

```python
from langchain.document\_loaders import UnstructuredEPubLoader  

```

```python
loader = UnstructuredEPubLoader("winter-sports.epub")  

```

```python
data = loader.load()  

```

## Retain Elements[â€‹](#retain-elements "Direct link to Retain Elements")

Under the hood, Unstructured creates different "elements" for different chunks of text. By default we combine those together, but you can easily keep that separation by specifying `mode="elements"`.

```python
loader = UnstructuredEPubLoader("winter-sports.epub", mode="elements")  

```

```python
data = loader.load()  

```

```python
data[0]  

```

```text
 Document(page\_content='The Project Gutenberg eBook of Winter Sports in\nSwitzerland, by E. F. Benson', lookup\_str='', metadata={'source': 'winter-sports.epub', 'page\_number': 1, 'category': 'Title'}, lookup\_index=0)  

```
