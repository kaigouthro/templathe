# Async Chromium

Chromium is one of the browsers supported by Playwright, a library used to control browser automation.

By running `p.chromium.launch(headless=True)`, we are launching a headless instance of Chromium.

Headless mode means that the browser is running without a graphical user interface.

`AsyncChromiumLoader` load the page, and then we use `Html2TextTransformer` to trasnform to text.

```bash
pip install -q playwright beautifulsoup4  
 playwright install  

```

```python
from langchain.document\_loaders import AsyncChromiumLoader  
urls = ["https://www.wsj.com"]  
loader = AsyncChromiumLoader(urls)  
docs = loader.load()  
docs[0].page\_content[0:100]  

```

```text
 '<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en"><head><script src="https://s0.2mdn.net/instream/video/client.js" asyn'  

```

```python
from langchain.document\_transformers import Html2TextTransformer  
html2text = Html2TextTransformer()  
docs\_transformed = html2text.transform\_documents(docs)  
docs\_transformed[0].page\_content[0:500]  

```
