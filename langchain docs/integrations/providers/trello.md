# Trello

[Trello](https://www.atlassian.com/software/trello) is a web-based project management and collaboration tool that allows individuals and teams to organize and track their tasks and projects. It provides a visual interface known as a "board" where users can create lists and cards to represent their tasks and activities.
The TrelloLoader allows us to load cards from a `Trello` board.
