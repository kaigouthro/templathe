# Writer

This page covers how to use the Writer ecosystem within LangChain.
It is broken into two parts: installation and setup, and then references to specific Writer wrappers.

## Installation and Setup[​](#installation-and-setup "Direct link to Installation and Setup")

- Get an Writer api key and set it as an environment variable (`WRITER_API_KEY`)

## Wrappers[​](#wrappers "Direct link to Wrappers")

### LLM[​](#llm "Direct link to LLM")

There exists an Writer LLM wrapper, which you can access with

```python
from langchain.llms import Writer  

```
