# Beautiful Soup

[Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) is a Python package for parsing
HTML and XML documents (including having malformed markup, i.e. non-closed tags, so named after tag soup).
It creates a parse tree for parsed pages that can be used to extract data from HTML,\[3\] which
is useful for web scraping.
