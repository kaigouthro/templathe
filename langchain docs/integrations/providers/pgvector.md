# PGVector

This page covers how to use the Postgres [PGVector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) ecosystem within LangChain
It is broken into two parts: installation and setup, and then references to specific PGVector wrappers.

## Installation[​](#installation "Direct link to Installation")

- Install the Python package with `pip install pgvector`

## Setup[​](#setup "Direct link to Setup")

1. The first step is to create a database with the `pgvector` extension installed.

Follow the steps at [PGVector Installation Steps](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector#installation) to install the database and the extension. The docker image is the easiest way to get started.

whether for semantic search or example selection.

To import this vectorstore:

```python
from langchain.vectorstores.pgvector import PGVector  

```
