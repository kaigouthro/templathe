# Slack

This notebook shows how to use the Slack chat loader. This class helps map exported slack conversations to LangChain chat messages.

The process has three steps:

1. Export the desired conversation thread by following the [instructions here](https://slack.com/help/articles/1500001548241-Request-to-export-all-conversations).

1. Create the `SlackChatLoader` with the file path pointed to the json file or directory of JSON files

1. Call `loader.load()` (or `loader.lazy_load()`) to perform the conversion. Optionally use `merge_chat_runs` to combine message from the same sender in sequence, and/or `map_ai_messages` to convert messages from the specified sender to the "AIMessage" class.

1. Create message dump[​](#1-create-message-dump "Direct link to 1. Create message dump")

______________________________________________________________________

Currently (2023/08/23) this loader best supports a zip directory of files in the format generated by exporting your a direct message conversation from Slack. Follow up-to-date instructions from slack on how to do so.

We have an example in the LangChain repo.

```python
import requests  
  
permalink = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/langchain-ai/langchain/342087bdfa3ac31d622385d0f2d09cf5e06c8db3/libs/langchain/tests/integration\_tests/examples/slack\_export.zip"  
response = requests.get(permalink)  
with open("slack\_dump.zip", "wb") as f:  
 f.write(response.content)  

```

2. Create the Chat Loader[​](#2-create-the-chat-loader "Direct link to 2. Create the Chat Loader")

______________________________________________________________________

Provide the loader with the file path to the zip directory. You can optionally specify the user id that maps to an ai message as well an configure whether to merge message runs.

```python
from langchain.chat\_loaders.slack import SlackChatLoader  

```

```python
loader = SlackChatLoader(  
 path="slack\_dump.zip",  
)  

```

3. Load messages[​](#3-load-messages "Direct link to 3. Load messages")

______________________________________________________________________

The `load()` (or `lazy_load`) methods return a list of "ChatSessions" that currently just contain a list of messages per loaded conversation.

```python
from typing import List  
from langchain.chat\_loaders.base import ChatSession  
from langchain.chat\_loaders.utils import (  
 map\_ai\_messages,  
 merge\_chat\_runs,  
)  
  
raw\_messages = loader.lazy\_load()  
# Merge consecutive messages from the same sender into a single message  
merged\_messages = merge\_chat\_runs(raw\_messages)  
# Convert messages from "U0500003428" to AI messages  
messages: List[ChatSession] = list(map\_ai\_messages(merged\_messages, sender="U0500003428"))  

```

### Next Steps[​](#next-steps "Direct link to Next Steps")

You can then use these messages how you see fit, such as fine-tuning a model, few-shot example selection, or directly make predictions for the next message.

```python
from langchain.chat\_models import ChatOpenAI  
  
llm = ChatOpenAI()  
  
for chunk in llm.stream(messages[1]['messages']):  
 print(chunk.content, end="", flush=True)  

```

 Hi,   
   
 I hope you're doing well. I wanted to reach out and ask if you'd be available to meet up for coffee sometime next week. I'd love to catch up and hear about what's been going on in your life. Let me know if you're interested and we can find a time that works for both of us.   
   
 Looking forward to hearing from you!  
   
 Best, [Your Name]
